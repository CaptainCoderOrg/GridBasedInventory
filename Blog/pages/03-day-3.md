# Day 3: Grid Logic System
{: .no_toc }

Today, we explored using the UI Toolkit once again to create parameterized
elements that can be reused in the UI Toolkit builder. More specifically, we
implemented a reusable `GridElement` component. Additionally, we explored how to
do 9-slicing on sprites within the UI Toolkit Builder to automatically resize 
our container borders to wrap the size of the grid.

## Today's Tasks

1. <s>Create Reusable GridSlotElement Template with CellSize parameter</s>
2. <s>Create GridElement Template with Rows, Columns, and CellSize parameter</s>
3. <s>Explore 9-slice Inventory Panel for background</s>

## Create Reusable GridSlotElement

The first goal was to attempt to create a reusable `GridSlotElement` that would be
used to represent a single cell of an inventory on the screen. The main idea
is that this should be a single element that can be easily modified to change
the look and feel of a slot throughout the program with ease.

To do this, we created a subclass of the `VisualElement`. One requirement to use
a `VisualElement` in the UI Builder is that it **MUST** provide a zero-argument
constructor. To style it, we will provide a `.grid-slot` class that can be swapped
out in any program to change the styling:

```csharp
public class GridSlotElement : VisualElement
{
    public GridSlotElement()
    {
        AddToClassList("grid-slot");
    }

    public int CellSize { get; set; }
}
```

To be able to access a `VisualElement` in the UI Builder, you must also provide a
`UxmlFactory` that knows how to create it. From the documentation, the canonical way
of doing this is to create an inner class that shadows the parent class name using
the `new` keyword:

```csharp
public class GridSlotElement : VisualElement
{
    // ...

    public new class UxmlFactory : UxmlFactory<GridSlotElement> { }
}
```

With just this, you will have a `GridSlotElement` available in the UI Builder's 
Custom Controls Library.

However, because we would also like to provide the ability to specify the
`CellSize` in the UI Builder, we must also provide a `UxmlTraits` specifically for
the `GridSlotElement`. Again, this is canonically done by shadowing the parent class and
overriding the `Init` method:

```csharp
public class GridSlotElement : VisualElement
{
    public GridSlotElement()
    {
        AddToClassList("grid-slot");
    }

    public int CellSize { get; set; }

    // Must use UxmlFactory<GridSlotElement, UxmlTraits> to get the traits in the UI Builder
    public new class UxmlFactory : UxmlFactory<GridSlotElement, UxmlTraits> { }

    // Shadows the name for convenience
    public new class UxmlTraits : VisualElement.UxmlTraits
    {
        // There are a variety of Uxml Attributes you can create for CellSize we want an int
        private UxmlIntAttributeDescription _cellSize = new () { name = "cell-size", defaultValue = 32 };

        public override void Init(VisualElement ve, IUxmlAttributes bag, CreationContext cc)
        {
            base.Init(ve, bag, cc);
            // TODO: What should we do to intialize this element?
        }
    }
}
```

One thing I found quite annoying was the requirement that the `name` attribute on this line:

```csharp
private UxmlIntAttributeDescription _cellSize = new () { name = "cell-size", defaultValue = 32 };
```

must use kebab case and match with a public property that uses Pascal or camelCasing in the parent class:

```csharp
public int CellSize { get; set; }
```

I wasn't able to find where this was documented and took quite a bit of time to discover.

To be able to set the `CellSize` we added an `Init` method to the class that
serves as a "constructor" for the object and sets the `width` and `height` of
the cell. Lastly, we updated the `UxmlTraits.Init` to forward the information from
the UI Builder to the element:

```csharp
public class GridSlotElement : VisualElement
{
    public GridSlotElement(int cellSize) : this() => Init(cellSize);
    public GridSlotElement() => AddToClassList("grid-slot");
    public int CellSize { get; set; }

    private void Init(int cellSize) {
        CellSize = cellSize;
        style.width = cellSize;
        style.height = cellSize;
    }

    public new class UxmlFactory : UxmlFactory<GridSlotElement, UxmlTraits> { }
    public new class UxmlTraits : VisualElement.UxmlTraits
    {
        private UxmlIntAttributeDescription _cellSize = new () { name = "cell-size", defaultValue = 32 };
        public override void Init(VisualElement ve, IUxmlAttributes bag, CreationContext cc)
        {
            base.Init(ve, bag, cc);
            var slot = ve as GridSlotElement;
            slot.Init(_cellSize.GetValueFromBag(bag, cc));
        }
    }
}
```

With this added, we can now add `GridElement`s to UI Document using the UI Builder and
adjust the size using the `CellSize` property:

<video autoplay="true" loop="true" style="max-width:700px">
  <source src="../imgs/resize-gridslot-element.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

## Create Reusable GridElement

With a basic understanding of creating custom elements in the UI Builder, we continued
to implement a `GridRowElement` which provides a `Columns` and `CellSize` attribute 
and is composed with multiple `GridSlot`s within.

<video autoplay="true" loop="true" style="max-width:700px">
  <source src="../imgs/resize-gridrow-element.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

And finally, a `GridElement` which provides a `Rows`, `Columns`, and `CellSize` and is
composed of multiple `GridRowElement`s:

<video autoplay="true" loop="true" style="max-width:700px">
  <source src="../imgs/resize-grid-element.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

## Implement and Auto Sizing 9-Slice Inventory Panel

Elitestomper, an amazing member of the crew, designed a fantastic UI component
that we wanted to use as a border for the inventory. Using the old Unity UI
Canvas system, it is very easy to take an image and us a technique called
[9-Slice] to make dialogs / windows resize in a nice way. To do this
in UI Toolkit is slightly different but not difficult.

We created a new UXML Document to use as a wrapper for our inventory grid
and added a `VisualElement` which would be a container for the grid. Our goal
was to make that element use the sprite and dynamically resize to the size of
a `GridElement`. Here is the final result:

<video autoplay="true" loop="true" style="max-width:700px">
  <source src="../imgs/resize-inventory-grid.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

To accomplish this we created an `inventory-border` style which is applied to
the parent container. It specifies the sprite we would like to use as a
background, as well as how to slice it. Additionally, we specify a padding to
push the grid within the bounds. 

```css
.inventory-border {
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
    background-image: url('project://database/Assets/Sprites/InventoryMainBox.png');
    -unity-background-scale-mode: stretch-to-fill;
    -unity-slice-left: 30;
    -unity-slice-top: 30;
    -unity-slice-right: 30;
    -unity-slice-bottom: 30;
    padding-left: 30px;
    padding-right: 30px;
    padding-top: 30px;
    padding-bottom: 30px;
}
```

Not too bad! Now that we have a reusable InventoryGrid component, we are ready
to attempt to implement a drag and drop inventory system. We only have 2 days
left to finish! Can we do it? Only time will tell!
