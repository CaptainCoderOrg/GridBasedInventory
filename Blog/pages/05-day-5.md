# Day 5: Polish and Package
{: .no_toc }

Today, we used Leonaro.AI to generate equipment graphics, added a UI component
for items, and connected the inventory grid logic with the UI through a
controller script.

## Today's Tasks

1. <s>Clean up UI, image order, inventory positioning</s>
2. <s>Implement move between "containers"</s>
3. <s>Learn how to package as a Unity Asset</s>
4. <s>Add asset to new project to test</s>

## Clean up UI, Image Order, and Inventory Positioning

On Day 4, we finished the basic functionality of a single inventory container.
With that behind us, it was time to clean up the UI. First, we made it such that
while an item is selected, it appears slightly offset from the inventory grid
and appear on top of other items. This was done by introducing an offset
variable and calling the `BringToFront()` method which forces an element to
move to the front of other elements within its container.

With this complete, we wanted to have a system in which the items could be
transferred between two containers. To accomplish this, we introduced an
`ItemCursorController` `MonoBehaviour` which would be capable of tracking an
item on the cursor. When an item is clicked, it is removed and a reference
is stored on the cursor. Then, when the container is clicked, the item is
removed from the cursor and added within that container.

```csharp
public class ItemCursorController<T> : MonoBehaviour where T : class, IGridableItem
{
    public event System.Action<GridSlotElement, GridElement> OnPointerEntered;
    private VisualElement _container;
    [field: SerializeField]
    public UIDocument TopLayer { get; private set; }
    private GridItemElement<T> _selected = null;
    public GridItemElement<T> Selected { get => _selected; set => _selected = value; }

    public void OnPointerEnter(GridSlotElement slot, GridElement grid) => OnPointerEntered?.Invoke(slot, grid);

    private void Awake()
    {
        VisualElement root = GetComponent<UIDocument>().rootVisualElement;
        root.RegisterCallback<PointerMoveEvent>(OnPointerMove);
        _container = TopLayer.GetComponent<UIDocument>().rootVisualElement.Q<VisualElement>("Container");
    }

    private void OnPointerMove(PointerMoveEvent evt)
    {
        if (_selected == null) { return; }
        _selected.Parent = null;
        _container.Add(_selected);
        _selected.style.left = evt.position.x;
        _selected.style.top = evt.position.y;
    }
}
```

The final result can be seen below:

## Packaging as a Unity Asset

With a grid based inventory working decently, we were ready to package it up as
a Unity Asset. To do this, we organized the code such that it was self contained
in two folders: `CaptainCoder` and `Demo`. The `CaptainCoder` folder contains
all necessary dlls, scripts, and images to implement your very own inventory
system and `Demo` contains a demo scene and custom item implementation to
demonstrate how to extend the provided library to create a custom inventory.

With this set up, it was easy to export as a Unity Asset by selecting the two
folders and selecting `Export Package`. This produced a self contained `.unityasset`
file which when dragged into a new project expands with the provided folders.

And with that, we were done with the basic inventory system. There are many
additional features that I would love to implement in the future. But, I
learned a ton and had fun doing it!
